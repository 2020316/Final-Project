    "# Predict Calories Burned Interface\n",
    "The predict_calories function is a user-interactive Python interface designed to estimate the number of calories burned during exercise based on various user inputs and a pre-trained machine learning model. This function uses a trained RandomForestRegressor model to predict the calories burned. Below is a detailed explanation of the interface and its functionality.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "Function Overview   \n",
    "The predict_calories function takes a machine learning model as its parameter and interacts with the user to gather necessary inputs. The function performs the following steps:   \n",
    "   \n",
    "User Input Collection:   \n",
    "   \n",
    "Gender: The user is prompted to enter their gender (male or female).   \n",
    "Age: The user enters their age in years.   \n",
    "Height: The user provides their height in centimeters.   \n",
    "Weight: The user inputs their weight in kilograms.   \n",
    "Duration: The user specifies the duration of their exercise in minutes.   \n",
    "Heart Rate: The user indicates their heart rate in beats per minute (bpm) during exercise.   \n",
    "Body Temperature: The user enters their body temperature in Celsius during exercise.   \n",
    "Data Encoding and Preparation:   \n",
    "   \n",
    "The gender input is encoded as a binary value (1 for male and 0 for female).\n",
    "The collected inputs are assembled into a NumPy array to be used as input features for the prediction model.   \n",
    "Prediction:   \n",
    "   \n",
    "The function checks if the provided model has a predict method and is properly fitted. If the model is not fitted, an error is raised, instructing the user to fit the model first.   \n",
    "The model is used to predict the number of calories burned based on the input features.   \n",
    "Output:   \n",
    "   \n",
    "The estimated number of calories burned is printed to the user in a formatted message.   \n",
    "Example Usage:   \n",
    "To use the predict_calories function, ensure you have a trained RandomForestRegressor model named rf_model.    "
